# Strategic FMS Demo from albatross.ai
It is a demo software for AFAS demostration with predicted airspace structure and flight rules,
and it will be incrementally updated to provide the lab environment and simulation environment for verification and validation of AFAS
Assumption:
1. Only position loop is implemented within the autopilot
2. highly structured airspace will be leverage firstly to ensure the safety margin
It includes:
1. ArcGis to demonstrate the aircraft flying scenario
2. A independent module to communicate the visual system which is Microsoft Flight Simulator
3. A Traffic simualated as a reasonable fidelity
4. A low fidelity autopilot was provided as the downstream of the AFAS
